# Libft

**Libft ([42cursus](https://www.42.fr)) 2021**

**Actual Status :** in progress 

**Result :** -

This project is about coding a C library. It contains many general-purpose functions that my next programs written for School 42 in C will rely on. This project is dedicated to understanding how standard functions work in С, their implementation and training in their use.

## Part 1 - Libc functions:

This is a set of functions from libc. The functions have the
same prototypes and the same behavior as the originals. They are fully consistent with how they are defined in their man. The only difference is their names. They
start with the prefix ’ft_’. For example, strlen becomes ft_strlen.

## Part 2 - Additional Functions:

This is a set of functions that either do not exist in libc,
or that are part of it, but in a different form.

Their detailed description can be found [here](https://github.com/AGolz/Libft_42Yerevan/blob/main/en.subject.pdf), page 7.

Run `make` to compile the **libft** library .

```
$>./make
libft.a:   object files are created
libft.a:   libft.a created
```
